# Horiseon - SEO, Accessibility standards, and Code Refractions

## Description of Repository
​
 The Horiseon-SEO repository is the result of a marketing agency wanting their existing codebase to follow accessibility standards so that their website is optimized when view by search engines.  The acceptance criteria was based on when the agency views the source code they would find:  

 * A source code consistent with semantic HTML structure. 
 * HTML elements that follow logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
 * Image element with alt attributes.
 * Heading attributes in sequential order. 
 * A title element with a concise, description title. 

## The Problem With The Original Code Base.
 The codebase presented was heavily riddle with class for form and reliant on a css.style sheet for styling and positioning.
